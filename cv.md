## About myself

My career started as a designer of alarm systems. After a year, I was promoted to the head of the design department. Now I'm interested in coding and have started studying Front-end development. I took the SheCodes courses, but after completing them, I realized that I needed to enhance my theoretical knowledge. I decided to read John Duckett's book 'HTML and CSS' to deepen my understanding. I am dedicated to improving my theoretical knowledge and practical skills every day.
Briefly about myself: Through my experience, I have learned how to effectively fulfill my intended purpose, organize both myself and others, and find solutions to problems of various complexities.
